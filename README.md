# Coronavirus_live_update_app

This is an app i made using python and another app called parsehub which lets me get the necessary data.

To get the worldwide data, just type in "all"
and to get the data of any other country, just simply type the countries name

A run request is sent to parsehub everytime you run this program, so to get more recent info about the pandemic
you will need to run it again after 5-10 minutes
