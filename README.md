# Coronavirus_live_update_app

This is an app i made using python and another app called parsehub which lets me get the necessary data.

To get the worldwide data, just type in "all"
and to get the data of any other country, just simply type the countries name

The info wont be the latest unless i manually update the info from the parsehub app
